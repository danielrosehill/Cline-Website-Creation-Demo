This repository demonstrates how to effectively structure and organize AI prompts and editing instructions as repository files that can be referenced by AI tools like Roo Code and Cline. It was created as part of a tutorial video for [Daniel's Tech World YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Lgg5Rgago).

## Project Overview

The project showcases a demo website build using AI assistance, where the development instructions and specifications are stored as markdown files within the repository. This approach allows for better version control of AI prompts and makes it easier to maintain consistency across multiple AI interactions.
