# Site Creation Prompt
 
 Develop a personal landing page website for me. My name is Cornelius and I am a sloth. 
 I'd like a single page landing site that can be deployed onto Netflify
 I have written cite text in the home page dot MD file in the repository and I've added some images of me into the images that are nested under the gallery folder. Use the text that I've drafted and use the images. I'd also like to have a nice attractive badge directing to my Instagram profile. 
 The goal is to make the website fun and quirky and honor my personality as a sloth. So try to use some creative fonts and designs and make sure that it also renders nicely on mobile devices
